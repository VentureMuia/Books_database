# Books_database
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques. 
In this project i have used pythons sqlite3 in creating the backend. The front end is done using tkinter. 
Further, a standalone executable verision is created for windows using pythons pyinstaller.
